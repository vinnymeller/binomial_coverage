paper: https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1009213286 (Interval Estimation for a Binomial Proportion: Lawrence D. Brown, T. Tony Cai, and Anirban DasGupta)

We went over this paper in class and I hadn't come across the concept of coverage probability. To make sure I understood it fully I made an interactive tool that shows the coverage probability for binomial proportions for a given p for sample sizes from 10 to your chosen n.
